# lm-dashboard
Lisp Machine Inspired Dashboard

This is a package for learning how to use Emacs Widgets.

It aims to offer a Dashboard-like experience that resembles
some Lisp Machine initial pages such as of Symbolics Genera.

It is way less powerful than emacs-dashboard at the moment, but aims
to integrate more functions and compatibilities in future.
